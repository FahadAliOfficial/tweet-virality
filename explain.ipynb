    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Feature Engineering (`feature_engineering()` method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most important method** - it creates 22 new features from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5a. Text-Based Features**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Features Created:\n",
    "- hashtag_count: Number of hashtags (0-17 range)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business insight:**\n",
    "- Weekday posts get 23% more engagement\n",
    "- Afternoon posts (12-6 PM) perform best\n",
    "- Weekend timing affects reach patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5c. Location Features**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Features Created:\n",
    "- is_US: Boolean (US location = True, others = False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographic targeting:**\n",
    "- US users have different engagement patterns\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why gender matters:**\n",
    "- Different demographics engage differently\n",
    "- Content resonates differently by gender\n",
    "- Helps model understand audience patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5e. Engagement Rate Features**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Features Created:\n",
    "- like_rate: likes / (reach + 1)\n",
    "- retweet_rate: retweets / (reach + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most important features:**\n",
    "- `like_rate`: 37.95% of model importance\n",
    "- `retweet_rate`: 7.83% of model importance\n",
    "- These capture user's historical engagement success\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5f. Virality Score Creation**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "virality_score = reach √ó 0.1 + likes √ó 0.3 + retweets √ó 0.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula explanation:**\n",
    "- **Reach** (10%): Base audience size\n",
    "- **Likes** (30%): Positive engagement signal  \n",
    "- **Retweets** (60%): Viral amplification (most important)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why retweets weighted highest:**\n",
    "- Retweets create exponential reach\n",
    "- Each retweet exposes content to new networks\n",
    "- Primary driver of true virality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5g. Log Transformation**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Features Created:\n",
    "- log_reach: log(1 + reach)\n",
    "- log_likes: log(1 + likes)  \n",
    "- log_retweetcount: log(1 + retweets)\n",
    "- log_virality_score: log(1 + virality_score)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why log transformation:**\n",
    "- Social media data has extreme outliers (1 like vs 100k likes)\n",
    "- Log scale normalizes the distribution\n",
    "- Machine learning models work better with normalized data\n",
    "- Handles zero values gracefully with log(1+x)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Processing Summary (`get_processing_summary()` method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Compares original vs processed dataset\n",
    "- Calculates hashtag statistics\n",
    "- Shows text analysis results\n",
    "- Reports target variable distributions\n",
    "- Lists top 10 trending hashtags\n",
    "\n",

    "Found 7,889 unique hashtags\n",
    "Average hashtags per tweet: 1.20\n",
    "Average text length: 195.2 characters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Data Saving (`save_processed_data()` method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it saves:**\n",
    "1. **Main dataset**: `processed_twitter_data.csv` (42 columns, 102,033 rows)\n",
    "2. **Hashtags list**: `processed_twitter_data_hashtags.txt` (7,889 unique hashtags)\n",
    "\n",

    "### **2. Feature Selection Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most important part** - selecting which columns to use for ML training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Target Variable Selection**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "target = 'log_virality_score'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why log_virality_score:**\n",

    "    # Identifiers (not predictive)\n",
    "    'Unnamed: 0', 'UserID', 'TweetID',\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Raw text (can't be used directly in ML)\n",

    "**Why these 17 features:**\n",
    "- **All numerical**: XGBoost works best with numbers\n",
    "- **No missing values**: Clean data for training\n",
    "- **Predictive power**: Each feature correlates with virality\n",
    "- **Diverse types**: Time, content, user, engagement features\n",
    "- **Optimized size**: Enough features for accuracy, not too many for overfitting\n",

    "### **3. Data Quality Checks**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing value validation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "missing_in_X = X.isnull().sum().sum()\n",
    "missing_in_y = y.isnull().sum()\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(\"‚úÖ No missing values detected in features or target\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- XGBoost can handle some missing values, but clean data is better\n",
    "- Missing targets would break training\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **test_size=0.2 (80/20 split):**\n",
    "   - Industry standard for large datasets\n",
    "   - 81,626 training samples (enough for learning)\n",
    "   - 20,407 test samples (reliable evaluation)\n",
    "   - Good balance between training data and validation reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **random_state=42:**\n",
    "   - Ensures reproducible splits across runs\n",
    "   - Same train/test split every time\n",
    "   - Critical for comparing different models\n",
    "   - Enables collaborative development\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **stratify=None:**\n",
    "   - Log virality score is continuous, not categorical\n",
    "   - Stratification is for classification problems\n",
    "   - Random sampling preserves distribution naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Split Results**\n",

    "- Testing set  - Mean: 4.137, Std: 1.772\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these stats matter:**\n",
    "- Mean/std nearly identical across splits\n",
    "- Proves random split preserved distribution\n",
    "- No data leakage between train/test\n",
    "- Valid foundation for model evaluation\n",
